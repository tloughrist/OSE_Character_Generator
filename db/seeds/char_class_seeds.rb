They often work
  in conjunction with thieves and may belong to a Thieves\' Guild. *Adjust ability scores: During character creation, acrobats may not lower STR.
  *Encumbrance: Evasion, falling, jumping, and tightrope walking cannot be performed if encumbrance reduces the acrobat\'s movement rate to less than 90\'(30\').', special: 'Acrobats can use the following skills with the chance of success shown opposite. 
  *Climb sheer surfaces (CS): A roll is required for each 100\' to be climbed. If the roll fails, the acrobat falls at the half-way point, suffering falling damage.
  *Falling (FA): When able to tumble, acrobats suffer no damage from the first 10\' of any fall. Damage due to falling from a greater height is reduced by the listed percentage (rounding fractions down).
  *Hide in shadows (HS): The acrobat must be motionlessâ€”attacking or moving while hiding is not possible.' },
